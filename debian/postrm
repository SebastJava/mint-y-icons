rm -rf /usr/share/icons/Mint-Yz-*

# The auto-generated postrm did not update-icon-caches on most "-Dark" variants.
# This caused some directories to be not empty and thus not deleted.
# And this caused some warning messages when doing GDebi updates.
# So, just erase it all, including some possible previous ones.
