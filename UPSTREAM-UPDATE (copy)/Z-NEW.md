# The z-new branch

The z-new branch is created as part of the process described in UPSTREAM-UPDATE-howto. It is the result of a ``git reset --hard upstream/master`` with added or replaced files. These new or replaced files are the ones that makes the difference between Mint-Y-icons and Mint-Yz-icons: this little "z" difference.

This should allow comparisons, edits, and pull request from sebastcolors.

To sum up, the sebastcolors branch got reset and updated to the latest upstream mint-y-icons master. And now, we are carefully going to compare and pull back again the little "z" difference into sebastcolors. And then, on local git repo, everything will be re-generated and pushed back here, as described in the My-complete-step-by-step guide.
